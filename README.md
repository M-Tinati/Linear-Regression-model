# Salary Prediction Model using Linear Regression

This project uses a linear regression model to predict a person's salary based on their years of experience. The dataset used is called `Salary_dataset.csv`, which contains two columns: `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and some Python libraries, which you can install using the following command:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and reading CSV files.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the linear regression model.

### Install Dependencies

To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:
